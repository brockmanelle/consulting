What is this research study about?

The purpose of this evidence-based clinical practice project is to implement TeamSTEPPS® in a student-led, faculty-guided community-based clinical setting, Bridges Health. An evidence-based practice change has been identified to incorporate the Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS®) training curriculum as an intervention that will provide formal organizational clinical education and organizational structure in an interprofessional (IP) leadership that changes the capacity and efficacy of the clinical practice site to prepare IP students for practice. Formalizing leadership and teamwork training will improve patient outcomes within an IP student-led, faculty-guided community-based clinical, Bridges Health. This clinical setting provides preventive health, wellness, and social care delivered through community-based services to underserved populations since 2017. IP students studying through Bridges Health include undergraduate and graduate athletic training, dental hygiene, nursing, social work, athletic training, and public health disciplines, from undergraduate, master's, and doctoral programs. Bridge's current leadership framework allows students to become leaders naturally and informally, however many future health professionals, including nursing students, accept leadership roles within the clinical model without completing an evidence-based practice program. The project aims to improve patient outcomes by assessing attitudes and perceptions of communication, leadership, and teamwork using a pretest and posttest design among Bridges IP licensed providers, preceptors, and mentors of health profession students.



What activities will this study involve?

Participants will be asked to participate in TeamSTEPPS® training via an electronic learning management system, Desire to Learn (D2L) to implement new skills and tools into practice at Bridges Health. Participants will be asked to partake in pre-and-post implementation surveys. 



How much time will this take?

The first phase of implementation will involve participants to complete up to four hours of TeamSTEPPS® training over one month, including the pre- and post-intervention data collection activities. This will also consist of the TeamSTEPPS® T-TAQ and T-TPQ instruments administered to participants through an electronic means called Qualtrics pre-and post-intervention. Participants will be de-identified and matched. The secondary implementation phase is the application of TeamSTEPPS® training and will occur two weeks into Fall 2022 at the clinical rotations at Bridges. The TeamSTEPPS® T-TAQ and T-TPQ instruments and qualitative questions will be administered electronically through Qualtrics. 



Are there any risks for participating? 

There are no appreciable risks from participating in this study. All data collected for this study is anonymous and will not be linked back to any of your identifying information.



Are there any benefits for participating?

The main benefit of participation is partaking in the strategic application of the TeamSTEPPS® training curriculum that emphasizes the prioritization of improving patient outcomes, team, and leadership performance outcomes, and enhances Bridge’s clinical licensed providers, preceptors, mentors, and health profession students’ attitudes, perceptions of overall healthcare delivery. Another benefit participants have is access to free TeamSTEPPS training. The main outcomes of the training consists of improved perceptions and attitudes towards teamwork and leadership, increased understanding, knowledge, and confidence in communication, mutual support, and  situation monitoring. 



What are my rights as a participant?

Participation in this study is voluntary and you may stop at any time. You may decide not to participate or to discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits. A decision not to participate or withdraw will not affect your current or future relationship with project leads or Bridges Health.
